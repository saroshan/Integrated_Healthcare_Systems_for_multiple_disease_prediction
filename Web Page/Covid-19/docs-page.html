						    <p>If you have COVID-19 it can take several days to develop symptoms — but you’re contagious during this time. You are no longer contagious 10 days after your symptoms began.</p>
							<h5><strong>The best way to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others is to:</strong></h5>
						<ul>
						    <li>Stay 6 feet away from others whenever possible.</li>
							<li>Wear a cloth mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.</li>
							<li>Wash your hands often. If soap isn’t available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
							<li>Avoid crowded indoor spaces. Open windows to bring in outdoor air as much as possible.</li>
							<li>Stay self-isolated at home if you are feeling ill with symptoms that could be COVID-19 or have a positive test for COVID-19.</li>

						<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">Diet</h2>
						<p><strong>Eat fresh and unprocessed foods every day</strong></p>
						<li>Eat fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice or starchy tubers or roots such as potato, yam, taro or cassava), and foods from animal sources (e.g. meat, fish, eggs and milk).</li>
						<li>Daily, eat: 2 cups of fruit (4 servings), 2.5 cups of vegetables (5 servings), 180 g of grains, and 160 g of meat and beans (red meat can be eaten 1−2 times per week, and poultry 2−3 times per week).</li>
						<li>For snacks, choose raw vegetables and fresh fruit rather than foods that are high in sugar, fat or salt.</li>
						<li>Do not overcook vegetables and fruit as this can lead to the loss of important vitamins.</li>
						<li>When using canned or dried vegetables and fruit, choose varieties without added salt or sugar.</li>
						<p><strong>   </strong></p>
						<p><strong>Drink enough water every day</strong></p>
						<li>Water is essential for life. It transports nutrients and compounds in blood, regulates your body temperature, gets rid of waste, and lubricates and cushions joints.</li>
						<li>Drink 8–10 cups of water every day</li>
						<li>Water is the best choice, but you can also consume other drinks, fruits and vegetables that contain water, for example lemon juice (diluted in water and unsweetened), tea and coffee. But be careful not to consume too much caffeine, and avoid sweetened fruit juices, syrups, fruit juice concentrates, fizzy and still drinks as they all contain sugar</li>
						<p><strong> </strong></p>
						<p><strong>Eat moderate amounts of fat and oil</strong></p>
						<li>Consume unsaturated fats (e.g. found in fish, avocado, nuts, olive oil, soy, canola, sunflower and corn oils) rather than saturated fats (e.g. found in fatty meat, butter, coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard).</li>
						<li>Choose white meat (e.g. poultry) and fish, which are generally low in fat, rather than red meat.</li>
						<li>Avoid processed meats because they are high in fat and salt.</li>
						<li>Where possible, opt for low-fat or reduced-fat versions of milk and dairy products.</li>
						<li>Avoid industrially produced trans fats. These are often found in processed food, fast food, snack food, fried food, frozen pizza, pies, cookies, margarines and spreads.</li>
						<p><strong> </strong></p>
						<p><strong>Eat less salt and sugar</strong></p>
						<li>When cooking and preparing food, limit the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce and fish sauce).</li>
						<li>Limit your daily salt intake to less than 5 g (approximately 1 teaspoon), and use iodized salt.</li>
						<li>Avoid foods (e.g. snacks) that are high in salt and sugar.</li>
						<li>Limit your intake of soft drinks or sodas and other drinks that are high in sugar (e.g. fruit juices, fruit juice concentrates and syrups, flavoured milks and yogurt drinks).</li>
						<li>Choose fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as cookies, cakes and chocolate.</li>
						<p><strong> </strong></p>
						<p><strong>Avoid eating out</strong></p>
						<p>Eat at home to reduce your rate of contact with other people and lower your chance of being exposed to COVID-19. We recommend maintaining a distance of at least 1 metre between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. That is not always possible in crowded social settings like restaurants and cafes.</p>

						<p><strong>Can I get COVID-19 from eating fresh foods, like fruits and vegetables? </strong></p>
						<p>There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food, including fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruits and vegetables are part of a healthy diet and their consumption should be encouraged.</p>
						<p><strong>How should I wash fruits and vegetables in the time of COVID-19?</strong></p>
						<p>Wash fruit and vegetables the same way you would in any other circumstance. Before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw</p>
						<p><strong>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 live on the surface of food packaging?</strong></p>
						<p>Coronaviruses need a live animal or human host to multiply and survive and cannot multiply on the surface of food packages. It is not necessary to disinfect food packaging materials, but hands should be properly washed after handling food packages and before eating</p>
						<p><strong>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the consumption of cooked foods, including animal products?</strong></p>
						<p>There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food. Foods such as meat, poultry and eggs should always be thoroughly cooked to at least 70°C. Before cooking, raw animal products should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with cooked foods</p>
						<p><strong>Is it safe to have groceries delivered?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes, it is safe to have groceries delivered if the provider follows good personal and food hygiene practices. After accepting food/grocery deliveries, hands should be properly washed.</p>

						    <p>it’s possible. There are several reasons for “false negative” test results — meaning you really do have COVID-19 although the test result says you don’t.</p>

				     <section class="docs-section" id="item-6-1">
						<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">Reasons</h2>
						<p><strong>Reasons for a false negative COVID-19 test result include:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>You were tested too early in the course of illness.</strong> The virus hasn’t multiplied in your body to the level that it could be detected by the test.</li>
							<li><strong>The swab didn’t get a good specimen.</strong> You or the healthcare personnel may not have swabbed deeply enough in your nasal cavity to collect a good sample. There could also be less likely handling errors and transportation errors.</li>
							<li><strong>The test itself was not sensitive or specific enough to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</strong> Sensitivity refers to the ability of the test to detect the smallest amount of virus. Specificity refers to the ability of the test to detect only the COVID-19 virus and not other similar viruses. Many different commercial and hospital laboratories have developed tests for SARS-CoV-2. All must meet standards, but there’s always the possibility of “false negative” and “false positive” tests.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you think you might have COVID-19 even if your test is negative, it’s best to follow the current CDC recommendations. Stay home for 10 days if you think you are sick (“social distancing”). Stay 6 feet away from others (“physical distancing”) and wear a cloth mask. Contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms worsen. Don’t decide on your own if it’s safe for you to be around others. Instead, contact your healthcare provider when your symptoms improve.</p>

						    <p>There has been huge progress in developing treatments for patients with COVID-19. Treatments for COVID-19 should be decided on an individual basis between the person and the healthcare professional looking after them. </p>

				     <section class="docs-section" id="item-7-1">
						<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">Treatment</h2>
						<p>Treatments for COVID-19 vary depending on the severity of your symptoms. If you’re not in the hospital or don’t need supplemental oxygen, no specific antiviral or immunotherapy is recommended.</p>
						<p><strong>Depending on the severity of your COVID symptoms, you may need:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Supplemental oxygen (given through tubing inserted into your nostrils).</li>
							<li>Some people may benefit from an infusion of monoclonal antibodies.</li>
							<li>Antiviral medications may reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in certain patients with COVID-19.</li>
							<li>Mechanical ventilation (oxygen through a tube inserted down your trachea). You are given medications to keep you comfortable and sleepy as long as you’re receiving oxygen through a ventilator.</li>
							<li>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). You continue to receive treatment while a machine pumps your blood outside your body. It takes over the function of your body’s lungs and heart.</li>

						</ul>

						<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">vaccinated</h2>
						<p><strong>Can vaccinated people still get COVID-19?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes, it’s possible to get COVID-19 even if you’ve been vaccinated. No vaccines are 100% effective. In fact, breakthrough cases (when someone tests positive more than two weeks after they're fully vaccinated) are expected, especially as the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates.

							The vaccines significantly reduce — but don’t eliminate — your risk of infection. The risk of a severe illness or death from a breakthrough infection is very low.</p>

							<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">Managed At Home</h2>
						<p><strong>If you have mild COVID-19 symptoms, you can likely manage your health at home. Follow these tips:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>If you have a fever,</strong> drink plenty of fluids (water is best), get lots of rest and take acetaminophen</li>
							<li><strong>If you have a cough,</strong> lie on your side or sit up (don’t lie on your back). Add a teaspoon of honey to your hot tea or hot water (don’t give honey to children under 1 year of age). Gargle with salt water. Call your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice about over-the-counter, comfort care products like cough suppressants and cough drops/lozenges. Have a friend or family member pick up any needed medicines. You must stay at home.</li>
							<li><strong>If you’re anxious about your breathing, try to relax.</strong> Take slow deep breaths in through your nose and slowly release through pursed lips (like you’re are slowly blowing out a candle).</li>
							<li><strong>If you’re having trouble breathing, call 911.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you have a mild case of COVID-19, you should start to feel better in a few days to a week. If you think your symptoms are getting worse, call your healthcare provider.</p>

					    <section class="docs-intro">
						    <p>The best defense to prevent getting COVID-19 is to get vaccinated. You should also follow the same steps you would take to prevent getting other viruses, such as the common cold or the flu.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds — especially before eating and preparing food, after using the bathroom, after wiping your nose, and after coming in contact with someone who has a cold.</li>
								<li>Wear a multilayered cloth facemask that fits snugly on your face and covers your mouth, nose and chin as recommended by the CDC.</li>
								<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the spread of viruses from your hands.</li>
								<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and coughing or sneeze and cough into your sleeve. Throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands afterward. Never cough or sneeze into your hands!</li>
								<li>Avoid close contact (within 6 feet) with those who have coughs, colds or are sick. Stay home if you’re sick.</li>
								<li>If you’re prone to sickness or have a weakened immune system, stay away from large crowds of people. Follow the directions of your healthcare authorities, especially during outbreaks.</li>
								<li>Clean frequently used surfaces (such as doorknobs and countertops) with a virus-killing disinfectant.</li>
								<li>Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</li>
								<li>Greet people with a friendly gesture instead of shaking hands.</li>
								<li>Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of liquids and exercise if you are able. These steps will strengthen your immune system and help you fight off infections more easily.</li>

						<p>Your healthcare provider can answer any questions you have about when you should wear a face mask to help slow the transmission of COVID-19. In general, the CDC recommends wearing a face mask in the following situations:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If you’re in an area with high community levels of COVID-19, wear a face mask in public.</li>
							<li>If you’re sick but can’t avoid being around others.</li>
							<li>If you’re caring for someone who has COVID-19.</li>
							<li>If you’re at higher risk for severe illness or live with someone who is.</li>

						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What happens to people who get COVID-19?</h5>
						<p>As testing rates fall, it is more difficult to know how many people have COVID-19 and do not seek any treatment. At the start of the pandemic, 15% of people were thought to become seriously unwell and require hospital treatment and oxygen</p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?</h5>
						<p>People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, diabetes, other chronic health problems (for example those affecting the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain), low immune function / immunosuppression (including HIV), obesity, cancer, and unvaccinated people are most at risk of severe illness</p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?</h5>
						<p>Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms. These long-term effects are called post COVID-19 condition (also called long COVID).</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">FAQ's <small>(Food)</small></h2>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What is the best household disinfectant for surfaces?</h5>
						<p>Regular household cleaning and disinfection products will effectively eliminate the virus from household surfaces.  For cleaning and disinfecting households with suspected or confirmed COVID19, surface virucidal disinfectants, such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and products based on ethanol (at least 70%), should be used.</p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>How should I wash fruits and vegetables in the time of COVID-19?</h5>
						<p>Wash fruit and vegetables the same way you would in any other circumstance. Before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw. </p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Can I get COVID-19 from eating fresh foods, like fruits and vegetables?</h5>
						<p>There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food, including fruits and vegetables. Fresh fruits and vegetables are part of a healthy diet and their consumption should be encouraged. </p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What foods should be consumed to support the immune system?</h5>
						<p>The immune system requires the support of many nutrients. It is recommended to consume a variety of foods for a healthy and balanced diet, including whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts and animal source foods. There is no single food that will prevent you from catching COVID-19. </p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Can eating ginger help prevent COVID-19?</h5>
						<p>No. There is no evidence that eating ginger has protected people from COVID-19. However, ginger is a food that may have some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties</p>

							<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">FAQ's <small>(vaccination)</small></h2>
						    <h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>How long does protection from a COVID-19 vaccine last?</h5>
							<p>Scientists are monitoring how long COVID-19 vaccine protection lasts. CDC continues to review evidence and update guidance as new information becomes available.</p>
							<p>At this time, 1 updated booster dose is recommended for everyone in order to maintain protection from severe illness. People who have received the updated booster in recent months are better protected against severe illness from COVID-19 than those who have not gotten the updated booster. Receiving more than 1 updated booster is not currently authorized by the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
							<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Am i required to get vaccinated for work?</h5>

							<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>Can i get more than one booster?</h5>
							<p>No. CDC recommends 1 updated booster dose at this time. FDA has not authorized receiving more than 1 updated booster.

								Recent data confirm that updated COVID-19 boosters help to protect people from serious COVID-19 illness. CDC will continue to provide updated information and guidance as the science becomes available.</p>
							<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What are the risks to getting booster?</h5>
							<p>Adults and children may have some side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine, including pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea. Serious side effects are rare, but may occur.</p>
