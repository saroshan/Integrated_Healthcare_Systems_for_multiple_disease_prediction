					    <p>A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain or near it. Brain tumors can happen in the brain tissue. Brain tumors also can happen near the brain tissue. Nearby locations include nerves, the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain.</p>
						<p>Brain tumors can begin in the brain. These are called primary brain tumors. Sometimes, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body. These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors.</p>
						<p>Many different types of primary brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. Noncancerous brain tumors may grow over time and press on the brain tissue. Other brain tumors are brain cancers, also called malignant brain tumors. Brain cancers may grow quickly. The cancer cells can invade and destroy the brain tissue.</p>
						<p>Brain tumors range in size from very small to very large. Some brain tumors are found when they are very small because they cause symptoms that you notice right away. Other brain tumors grow very large before they're found. Some parts of the brain are less active than others. If a brain tumor starts in a part of the brain that's less active, it might not cause symptoms right away. The brain tumor size could become quite large before the tumor is detected.</p>

							<ul>
								<li><strong>Gliomas and related brain tumors.</strong> Gliomas are growths of cells that look like glial cells. The glial cells surround and support nerve cells in the brain tissue. Types of gliomas and related brain tumors include astrocytoma, glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma and ependymoma. Gliomas can be benign, but most are malignant. Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain tumor.</li>
								<li><strong>Choroid plexus tumors.</strong>Choroid plexus tumors start in cells that make the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. Choroid plexus tumors are located in the fluid-filled cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. Choroid plexus tumors can be benign or malignant. Choroid plexus carcinoma is the malignant form of this type of brain tumor. It's more common in children.</li>
								<li><strong>Embryonal tumors.</strong> Embryonal tumors begin in cells that are left over from fetal development. The cells, called embryonal cells, stay in the brain after birth. Embryonal tumors are malignant brain tumors that happen most often in babies and young children. The most common type of embryonal tumor is medulloblastoma. It's usually located in the lower back part of the brain, called the cerebellum.</li>
								<li><strong>Germ cell tumors.</strong>  Germ cell tumors start in reproductive cells, called germ cells, that go on to become the sperm and egg cells. Germ cells are mostly in the ovaries and testicles. But sometimes they're in other parts of the body, including the brain. When germ cell tumors happen in the brain, they're often located near the pineal gland or the pituitary gland. Germ cell tumors are mostly benign. They're more common in children.</li>
								<li><strong>Pineal tumors.</strong> Pineal tumors start in and around the brain's pineal gland. The pineal gland is located in the center of the brain. It makes a hormone called melatonin that helps with sleep. Pineal tumors can be benign or malignant. Pineoblastoma is a malignant type of pineal tumor that's most common in children</li>
								<li><strong>Meningiomas.</strong>  Meningiomas are brain tumors that start in the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are usually benign, but sometimes they can be malignant. Meningiomas are the most common type of benign brain tumor.</li>
								<li><strong>Nerve tumors.</strong> Nerve tumors are growths that happen in and around nerves. The most common type that happens in the head is acoustic neuroma, also called schwannoma. This benign tumor is located on the main nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain.</li>
								<li><strong>Pituitary tumors.</strong> Brain tumors can begin in and around the pituitary gland. This small gland is located near the base of the brain. Most tumors that happen in and around the pituitary gland are benign. Pituitary tumors happen in the pituitary gland itself. Craniopharyngioma is a type of brain tumor that happens near the pituitary gland.</li>
								<li><strong>Other brain tumors.</strong> Many other types of rare tumors can happen in and around the brain. Tumors can start in the muscles, blood vessels and connective tissue around the brain. Tumors can form in the bones of the skull. Malignant brain tumors can start from the germ-fighting immune system cells in the brain. This type of brain cancer is called primary central nervous system lymphoma.</li>

						    <p>Doctors use many tests to find, or diagnose, a brain tumor and learn the type of brain tumor. They also do tests to find out if it has spread to another part of the body from where it started. This is called metastasis and is rare for a primary brain tumor. Doctors may also do tests to learn which treatments could work best.</p>
							<p>For most types of tumors, taking a sample of the possible tumor is the only sure way for the doctor to know if an area of the body has a tumor. This may be done in a procedure called a biopsy or by removing part or all of the tumor with surgery. In a biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue for testing in a laboratory. If this is not possible, the doctor may suggest other tests that will help make a diagnosis.</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">How a brain tumor is diagnosed</h2>
						<p>Imaging tests can help doctors find out if the tumor is a primary brain tumor or if it is cancer that has spread to the brain from elsewhere in the body. Imaging tests show pictures of the inside of the body. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The type of tumor suspected</li>
							<li>Your signs and symptoms</li>
							<li>Your age and general health</li>
							<li>The results of earlier medical tests</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Most brain tumors are diagnosed after symptoms appear. Often a brain tumor is first diagnosed by an internist or a neurologist. An internist is a doctor who specializes in treating adults. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in problems with the brain and central nervous system</p>
						<p>In addition to asking the patient for a detailed medical history and doing a physical examination, the doctor may recommend the tests described below. These tests are to help find out the presence, and sometimes the type or grade, of a brain tumor.</p>
						<p>In general, diagnosing a brain tumor usually begins with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Once MRI shows that there is a tumor in the brain, the most common way to determine the type of brain tumor is to look at the results from a sample of tissue after a biopsy or surgery. These tests and procedures are described below in more detail.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</strong> An MRI uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to produce detailed images of the body. MRI can be used to measure the tumor’s size. A special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to create a clearer picture. This dye can be injected into a patient’s vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow. MRIs create more detailed pictures than CT scans (see below) and are the preferred way to diagnose a brain tumor. The MRI may be of the brain, spinal cord, or both, depending on the type of tumor suspected and the likelihood that it will spread in the CNS. There are different types of MRI. The results of a neuro-examination, done by the internist or neurologist, helps determine which type of MRI to use.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Intravenous (IV) gadolinium-enhanced MRI is typically used to help create a clearer picture of a brain tumor. This is when a patient first has a regular MRI and afterwards is given a special type of contrast medium called gadolinium through an IV. Then, a second MRI is done to get another series of pictures using the dye.</li>
									<li>An MRI technique called "diffusion weighted imaging" helps show the cellular structure of the brain. Another technique called "perfusion imaging" shows how much blood is reaching the tumor. These methods may help doctors predict how well treatment will work.</li>
									<li>A spinal MRI may be used to diagnose a tumor on or near the spine</li>
									<li>A functional MRI (fMRI) provides information about the location of specific areas of the brain that are responsible for muscle movement and speech. During the fMRI examination, the patient is asked to do certain tasks that cause changes in the brain and can be seen on the fMRI image. This test is used to help plan surgery, so the surgeon can avoid damaging the functional parts of the brain while removing the tumor.</li>
									<li>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a test using an MRI that provides information on the chemical composition of the brain. It can help tell the difference between any dead tissue caused by previous radiation treatments and new tumor cells in the brain.</li>

								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><strong>Tissue sampling/biopsy/surgical removal of a tumor.</strong> A sample of the tumor’s tissue is usually needed to make a final diagnosis. A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope and is the only definitive way a brain tumor can be diagnosed. A pathologist then analyzes the sample(s). A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and evaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease. A biopsy can be done as part of surgery to remove the entire tumor. Or surgery may be done as a separate procedure if completely removing the tumor is not possible because of its location or a patient’s health.</li>
							<li><strong>CT scan.</strong> A CT scan takes pictures of the inside of the body using x-rays taken from different angles. A computer combines these pictures into a detailed, 3-dimensional image that shows any abnormalities or tumors. A CT scan can help find bleeding and enlargement of the fluid-filled spaces in the brain, called ventricles. Changes to bone in the skull can also be seen on a CT scan, and it can be used to measure a tumor’s size. A CT scan may also be used if the patient cannot have an MRI, such as if the person has a pacemaker for their heart. Sometimes, a contrast medium is given before the scan to provide better detail on the image. This dye can be injected into a patient’s vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow</li>
							<li><strong>Positron emission tomography (PET) or PET-CT scan.</strong> A PET scan is used at first to find out more about a tumor while a patient is receiving treatment. It may also be used if the tumor comes back after treatment. A PET scan is usually combined with a CT scan (see above), called a PET-CT scan. However, you may hear your doctor refer to this procedure just as a PET scan. A PET scan is a way to create pictures of organs and tissues inside the body using various substances, such as sugars or proteins. A small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into the patient’s body. This substance is taken up by cells that are actively dividing. Because tumor cells are more likely to be actively dividing, they absorb more of the radioactive substance. However, the amount of radiation in the substance is too low to be harmful. A scanner then detects this substance to produce images of the inside of the body.</li>
							<li><strong>Cerebral arteriogram, also called a cerebral angiogram. </strong> A cerebral arteriogram is an x-ray, or series of x-rays, of the head that shows the arteries in the brain. X-rays are taken after a special dye called a contrast medium is injected into the main arteries of the patient’s head.</li>
							<li><strong>Lumbar puncture or spinal tap.</strong>  A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is used to take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to look for tumor cells, blood, or tumor markers. Tumor markers or biomarkers are substances found in higher-than-normal amounts in the blood, urine, spinal fluid, plasma or other bodily fluids of people with certain types of tumors. Typically, a local anesthetic is given to numb the patient’s lower back before the procedure.</li>
							<li><strong>Myelogram.</strong> The doctor may recommend a myelogram to find out if the tumor has spread to the spinal fluid, other parts of the brain, or the spinal cord. A myelogram uses a dye injected into the CSF that surrounds the spinal cord. The dye shows up on an x-ray and can outline the spinal cord to help the doctor look for a tumor. This test is only done occasionally; a lumbar puncture (see above) is more common.</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Biomarker testing of the tumor. </strong> Your doctor may recommend running laboratory tests on a tumor sample to identify specific genes, proteins, and other factors, such as tumor markers, unique to the tumor. This may also be called molecular testing of the tumor. Some biomarkers may help doctors determine a patient’s prognosis, which is the chance of recovery (see Grades and Prognostic Factors). Researchers are examining biomarkers to find ways to diagnose a brain tumor before symptoms begin. Results of these tests may help determine your treatment options. The markers most commonly looked at for brain tumors include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>For oligodendroglioma, the loss of the p-arm of chromosome 1 and the loss of the q-arm of chromosome 19. This is called a 1p/19q co-deletion. It is linked to more successful treatment, particularly with chemotherapy. It can be used to help plan treatment, especially for anaplastic oligodendroglioma</li>
									<li>A mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene, which is found in about 70% to 80% of low-grade gliomas in adults. Higher-grade tumors can also have IDH gene mutations, which suggests that these tumors started as lower-grade tumors that became a higher grade. This mutation is linked with a better prognosis in both low-grade and high-grade tumors.</li>
									<li>In glioblastoma, whether a gene called methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) is changed can help the doctor understand a patient’s prognosis and how well treatment will work. Its role in determining the benefit of treatment is being tested in clinical trials.</li>

							</li>
							<li><strong>Neurological, vision, and hearing tests</strong> These tests help determine if a tumor is affecting how the brain functions. An eye examination can detect changes to the optic nerve, as well as changes to a person’s field of vision</li>
							<li><strong>Neurocognitive assessment.</strong> This consists of a detailed evaluation of all major functions of the brain, such as storage and retrieval of memory, expressive and receptive language abilities, calculation, dexterity, and the overall well-being of the patient. These tests are done by a licensed clinical neuropsychologist. This specialist will write a formal report to compare with future evaluations or identify specific problems that can be helped through treatment</li>
							<li><strong>Electroencephalography (EEG).</strong> An EEG is a noninvasive test in which electrodes are attached to the outside of a person's head to measure electrical activity of the brain. It is used to monitor for possible seizures (see Symptoms and Signs).</li>
							<li><strong>Evoked potentials.</strong> Evoked potentials involve the use of electrodes to measure the electrical activity of nerves and can often detect acoustic schwannoma, a noncancerous brain tumor. This test can be used as a guide when removing a tumor that is growing around important nerves</li>

						    <p>In most people with primary brain tumors, the cause isn't clear. But doctors have identified some factors that may raise the risk.</p>
							<p><strong>Risk factors include:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Age</strong> Brain tumors can happen at any age, but they happen most often in older adults. Some brain tumors mostly affect adults. Some brain tumors happen most often in children</li>
								<li><strong>Race</strong> Anyone can get a brain tumor. But some types of brain tumors are more common in people of certain races. For example, gliomas are more common in white people. Meningiomas are more common in Black people</li>
								<li><strong>Exposure to radiation</strong> People who have been exposed to a strong type of radiation have an increased risk of brain tumor. This strong radiation is called ionizing radiation. The radiation is strong enough to cause DNA changes in the body's cells. The DNA changes can lead to tumors and cancers. Examples of ionizing radiation include radiation therapy used to treat cancer and radiation exposure caused by atomic bombs</li>

						<p>Headaches are the most common symptom of brain tumors. Headaches happen in about half of people with brain tumors. Headaches can happen if a growing brain tumor presses on healthy cells around it. Or a brain tumor can cause swelling in the brain that increases pressure in the head and leads to a headache.</p>
						<p>Headache pain caused by brain tumors is often worse when you wake up in the morning. But it can happen at any time. Some people have headaches that wake them from sleep. Brain tumor headaches tend to cause pain that's worse when coughing or straining. People with brain tumors most often report that the headache feels like a tension headache. Some people say the headache feels like a migraine.</p>
						<p>Brain tumors in the back of the head might cause a headache with neck pain. If the brain tumor happens in the front of the head, the headache might feel like eye pain or sinus pain.</p>

					    <h1 class="docs-heading" style="color: #28b76b;"><i class="fas fa-mortar-pestle"></i> Treatments</h1>
					    <section class="docs-intro">
						    <p>Treatment for brain tumors depends on a number of factors including the type, location and size of the tumor as well as the patient's age and general health. Treatment methods and schedules differ for children and adults.</p>
							<p>Brain tumors are treated with surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Our doctors also are studying a vaccine for treating a recurrent cancer of the central nervous system that occurs primarily in the brain, known as glioma.</p>
							<p>Depending on your needs, several methods may be used. Our team includes neurosurgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, nurses, a dietitian and a social worker, who work together to provide the best possible care.</p>
							<h2 style="color:#515e58;">Surgery</h2>
							<p>Surgery is the usual treatment for most brain tumors. To remove a brain tumor, a neurosurgeon makes an opening in the skull. This operation is called a craniotomy. Whenever possible, the surgeon attempts to remove the entire tumor. If the tumor cannot be completely removed without damaging vital brain tissue, your doctor may remove as much of the tumor as possible. Partial removal helps to relieve symptoms by reducing pressure on the brain and reduces the amount of tumor to be treated by radiation therapy or chemotherapy.</p>
							<p>Some tumors cannot be removed. In such cases, your doctor may do only a biopsy. A small piece of the tumor is removed so that a pathologist can examine it under a microscope to determine the type of cells it contains. This helps your doctor decide which treatment to use.</p>
							<h2 style="color:#515e58;">Radiation therapy</h2>
							<p>Radiation therapy, also called radiotherapy, is the use of high-powered rays to damage cancer cells and stop them from growing. It is often used to destroy tumor tissue that cannot be removed with surgery or to kill cancer cells that may remain after surgery. Radiation therapy also is used when surgery is not possible.</p>
							<p>Radiation therapy may be given in two ways. External radiation comes from a large machine. Generally, external radiation treatments are given five days a week for several weeks. The treatment schedule depends on the type and size of the tumor and your age. Giving the total dose of radiation over an extended period helps to protect healthy tissue in the area of the tumor.</p>
							<p>External radiation may be directed just to the tumor, the surrounding tissue or the entire brain. Sometimes the radiation is also directed to the spinal cord. When the whole brain is treated, the patient often receives an extra dose of radiation to the area of the tumor. This boost can come from external radiation or from an implant.</p>
							<h2 style="color:#515e58;">Chemotherapy</h2>
							<p>Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. The doctor may use just one drug or a combination, usually giving the drugs orally or by injection into a blood vessel or muscle. Intrathecal chemotherapy involves injecting the drugs into the cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
							<p>Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles. A treatment period is followed by a recovery period, then another treatment period and so on. Patients often don't need to stay in the hospital for treatment and most drugs can be given in the doctor's office or clinic. However, depending on the drugs used, the way they are given and the patient's general health, a short hospital stay may be necessary.</p>
							<p>Advances in chemotherapy include direct placement into the tumor cavity using a new technique called convection enhanced delivery.</p>

						</div><!--//gallery-->
						<p>The brain is the most complicated organ in our body. Every area has a specific function that controls everything that we do. For years, doctors have had a rough map of the brain, but never to the degree that they could operate and know for sure how to avoid every critical portion since each person's brain is unique, causing variations in the map. This fact, combined with the sheer complexity of the brain, has challenged neurosurgeons for years.</p>
						<p>Through groundbreaking research pioneered at UCSF, an advanced brain mapping technique has enabled doctors to remove as much of a brain tumor as possible while minimizing the impact on the crucial areas of the brain that control movement, speech and the senses.</p>

						<p>UCSF, which began offering CyberKnife treatments in 2003, is one of only a few medical centers in California that offer the procedure. In many cases, patients treated with the CyberKnife today would have previously been considered untreatable with surgery or conventional radiation therapy.</p>
						<p>Radiosurgery minimizes radiation exposure to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. Compared to other radiosurgical treatments, the CyberKnife offers several advantages to patients, including rapid relief from pain and other symptoms.</p>
						<p>Treatments are performed on an outpatient basis, with each treatment lasting between 30 to 90 minutes. The number of treatments vary depending on the tumor size, location and shape, but typically only one to five daily sessions are required. The CyberKnife allows patients to lie comfortably on the procedure table without anesthesia while the robotic arm moves, without touching them, to treat all areas of the tumor.</p>

					<p>The Gamma Knife is an advanced radiation treatment for adults and children with small to medium brain tumors, abnormal blood vessel formations called arteriovenous malformations, epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, a nerve condition that causes chronic pain, and other neurological conditions.</p>
					<p>Despite its name, the Gamma Knife isn't a knife but is a machine that delivers a single, finely focused, high dose of radiation to its target, while causing little or no damage to surrounding tissue. Abnormalities measuring less than 3 centimeters, or 1 inch in diameter, can be treated with the Gamma Knife</p>
					<p>UCSF, which launched its Gamma Knife Radiosurgery Program in 1991, was the first medical center in Northern California to use a Leksell Gamma Knife to treat brain disorders. Since then, more than 3,600 patients have been treated using this state-of-the-art equipment. In 2007, UCSF acquired the Perfexion Leksell Gamma Knife, which offers the most precise treatment with improved patient comfort.</p>

					</div><!--//gallery-->
				<p>Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive technique that allows surgeons to precisely target and destroy brain tumors without harm to surrounding healthy tissue. In a process called ablation, the heat generated by a small laser is used to kill the cancer cells.</p>
				<p>We can use LITT for a variety of tumors, including newly diagnosed and recurrent gliomas as well as brain metastases (cancer that's spread to the brain from elsewhere in the body). It's an effective option for patients who can't have or don't want a craniotomy (the traditional surgical approach of cutting through the skull). LITT's advantages include a smaller incision, shorter hospital stay and faster recovery. We also use LITT to treat certain types of epilepsy.</p>
				<p>Demonstrating our commitment to providing the latest and most innovative treatments, UCSF Health was the first Northern California hospital to offer LITT for certain brain tumors and epilepsy. When someone may be a candidate for LITT, our team of neurosurgeons, neurologists and other specialists works collaboratively to evaluate that patient and recommend the best care plan.</p>

						    <p><strong>When diagnosed with a brain tumor and undergoing treatment, you may experience:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Nausea</li>
								<li>Vomiting</li>
								<li>Loss of appetite</li>
								<li>Change in taste</li>
								<li>Diarrhea</li>
								<li>Constipation</li>
							</ul>
							<p>While it may not always be easy, having a healthy, balanced diet can combat fatigue, help you feel better, and keep your body strong so you can cope more easily with treatment side effects. It can also help you heal and recover from your treatment more easily. When building a healthier diet plan, look at your current eating habits with a dietitian or nutritionist to develop a plan that best meets your personal needs. What works for one person, may not work for you. A drastic change in diet is not recommended. Even small changes can have a positive impact on your health.</p>
							<p><strong>Here are some dietary tips for tackling nausea when living with a brain tumor:</strong></p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Eat small, frequent meals –</strong> instead of eating three large meals, which can seem daunting when you don’t have an appetite or are feeling sick to your stomach, have six to eight smaller meals during the day.</li>
								<li><strong>Choose bland foods when coping with nausea or diarrhea –</strong> yogurt, toast, bananas, applesauce, hard-boiled eggs, potatoes, etc.</li>
								<li><strong>Eat more calorie-dense foods when coping with lack of appetite –</strong> full fat yogurt, proteins, protein bars/shakes Drink plenty of fluids – sip liquids throughout the day</li>
								<li><strong>Eat on a schedule </strong>rather than non-existent hunger cues when coping with lack of appetite</li>
								<li><strong>Try food swaps when coping with taste and smell changes –</strong>fresh fruit for canned, chicken for red meat, try something new</li>
								<li><strong>Add fiber to your diet and stay hydrated when coping with constipation</strong> Avoid gas-forming foods such as beans, broccoli, cauliflower, onions, garlic, etc</li>
								<li><strong>For constipation:</strong> avoid acidic juices (tomato, orange) and greasy, fried foods, try crackers and pretzels, keep your potassium up with bananas and sports drinks</li>
								<li><strong>Talk to your doctor and/or dietician –</strong> there may be medications, supplements, or specific dietary changes that are beneficial for you</li>

						<h2 class="section-heading" style="color: #198754;">Tips for a healthier diet</h2>
						<p>Healthy eating consists of the overall balance of your diet over weeks, months, and years and is a balance of protein, carbohydrates, fluids, healthy fats, and fruits and vegetables. These foods should be ones you enjoy and include as much variety as possible.</p>
						<p><strong>Protein</strong></p>
						<p>Protein is important for the growth and repair of all cells in your body, including red blood cells, white blood cells, muscles, and immune factors. During periods of stress (such as surgery and treatment) your body will need more protein.</p>
						<p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong></p>
						<p>Consist of sugars and starchy foods and provide energy. Starchy foods are a major source of fiber and are important in keeping your digestive system regular. Whole grains are an excellent choice because they retain all of their nutrients, including fiber, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals.</p>
						<p><strong>Fluids</strong></p>
						<p>Good hydration is vital for your body to work properly. Generally, 6-8 (8oz) glasses is recommended for adequate hydration</p>
						<p><strong>Healthy fats (monounsaturated)</strong></p>
						<p>ats provide energy, absorb vitamins, and protect your organs. Examples include oily fish (trout, salmon, tuna), olive and canola oil, nuts and seeds, avocado and olives</p>
						<p><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong></p>
						<p>Phytonutrients help support your immune system and are located in fruits and vegetables. It’s important to vary the colors of your fruits and vegetables to vary your phytonutrient intake</p>

						<p>In addition to physical exercise, try these tips and techniques to manage stress, and improve your mental and emotional well-being:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Practice mindfulness and meditation.</li>
							<li>
								<p>Use relaxation techniques such as:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Progressive muscle relaxation – focus on slowly tensing and relaxing each muscle group. Tense your muscles for about 5 seconds and then relax for 30 seconds and repeat</li>
									<li>Visualization – form mental images to take a visual journey to a peaceful, calming place or situation. Incorporate as many senses as you can, including smell, sight, sound, and touch.</li>
									<li>Other techniques such as deep breathing, massage, aromatherapy, music and art therapy, yoga, etc.</li>
								</ul>

						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What is a brain tumor?</h5>
						<p>A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells that have formed in the brain. Some brain tumors are malignant (cancerous), while others are not (non-malignant, non-cancerous or benign). A brain tumor can form in the brain or other parts of the central nervous system (CNS), such as the spine or cranial nerves. The brain plays a central role in the control of most bodily functions, including awareness, movements, sensations, thoughts, speech, and memory. A tumor can affect the brain’s ability to work properly and adequately perform such functions.</p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What is the difference between malignant and non-malignant brain tumors?</h5>
						<p>Whether a tumor is malignant or not depends on how quickly the cells reproduce. If the tumor is made up of cells that multiply slowly, then it is usually non-malignant; however, if the cells multiply and spread quickly, then the tumor is malignant.Non-malignant (benign) brain tumors are not cancerous. These types of tumors grow relatively slowly and do not tend to spread. Even though they are not cancerous, these tumors can still cause symptoms and may need treatment. A non-malignant brain tumor can still be a serious medical condition.</p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What is tumor grading?</h5>
						<p>Tumor grade has long been a way to define the aggressiveness of a tumor, particularly for malignant brain tumors such as glioma but also for non-malignant (benign) brain tumors including meningioma.

							Traditionally, tumors have been classified as grade 1 to 4 based on histology (cells as viewed under a microscope) and molecular markers. Grade 1 tumors occur primarily in children and represent a type separate from grade 2-4 (seen primarily in adults). Grade 2 tumors are considered low grade, but some can be aggressive. Grade 3 and 4 tumors are defined as high grade.</p>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle me-1"></i>What are molecular markers?</h5>
						<p>Not all brain tumors are the same. Some tumors have differences in the genetic or molecular makeup of the cells. These differences are called molecular markers, or biomarkers. Molecular markers are becoming increasingly important for brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. For example, some molecular markers help determine how aggressive a tumor may be. Others determine how responsive a tumor will be to treatment.</p>
